## Co-op work experience
1. Limbach Group Biological Mass Spectrometry

In the biological mass spec group, I designed and programmed algorithms using Python, C++ and CUDA to identify and characterize known and unknown ribonucleoside modifications. Our task was primarily in cluster analysis and signal analysis. 



2. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC)

At CCHMC, I worked in the Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology programming protein analysis software. Our task was to find ways to predict the binding sites of proteins based on their amino acid sequences. We trained models using various machine learning algorithms (Such as neural networks, booster treees, SVMs etc) in R, Python, and Perl.  Our models were trained on a high performance GPU cluster. 


3. Givaudan Digitized Flavours

At Digitized Flavours, we designed software to optimize the flavour profile of aromas generated using the Virtual Aroma Synthesizer. The bulk of our work was done in R, Python, and JS/CSS. Towards the end we began working on applications of virtual aroma synthesis to the metaverse. 


# Project Sought

I have currently planned to further the technology of digital aroma in the metaverse with my fellow co-ops from Givaudan.
